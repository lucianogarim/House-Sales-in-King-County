  Let's consider a fictional company called House Rocket, that works buying and selling houses. Your CEO needs to make good sales, and for that he needs the help of a data scientist. Over the course of the days, the CEO asks the data scientist some questions and he answers his questions by sending the answers by email. 
The CEO's ultimate goal after all the questions is to know which houses the company should buy cheap and resell more expensive.
